1. Breakout towards upper channel boundary ($0.37)

## Analystsâ€™ Bold Predictions

Market experts have identified critical support levels and growth potential:

> "ARB has established a new psychological floor at $0.32 â€“ we're witnessing the formation of a multi-year bull pattern."

Key forecasts include:
- **$1.00 Target**: Multiple analysts highlight this long-term milestone
- **Technical Resilience**: 78% of surveyed traders expect sustained momentum

### Whale Activity Monitoring
CoinGlass data reveals:

2. **Derivative Funding Rates**: Neutral at +0.025%
3. **Options Open Interest**: Flat at $85M

These metrics suggest the current rally lacks broad market participation, potentially creating vulnerability to profit-taking.
