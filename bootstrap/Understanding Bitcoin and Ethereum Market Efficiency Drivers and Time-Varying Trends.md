# Understanding Bitcoin and Ethereum Market Efficiency: Drivers and Time-Varying Trends

## Abstract

This study explores the **time-varying efficiency** of Bitcoin and Ethereum markets using the **Adjusted Market Inefficiency Magnitudes (AMIMs)** measure and **quantile regression analysis**. Analyzing daily data from August 7, 2016, to February 15, 2023, we identify key drivers of market (in)efficiency, including **global financial stress**, **liquidity**, **money flow**, and the **COVID-19 pandemic**. Results reveal that Bitcoin consistently exhibits higher efficiency than Ethereum, with both markets showing dynamic responses to external factors. Financial stress negatively impacts efficiency, while liquidity and money flow enhance market stability. The pandemic exacerbated inefficiencies across quantiles, highlighting the importance of crisis periods in shaping cryptocurrency dynamics.
