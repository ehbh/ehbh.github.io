## Setting Up the Project Environment  

### Project Requirements  
To begin, ensure you have:  
- Python 2.7 installed  
- SQLite3 database management system  
- Basic understanding of Python scripting  

### Folder Structure  
1. Create a project directory named `CryptoSimulator`.  
2. Download the cryptocurrency price database and place it in your project folder.

## Core Components of the Simulator  

### 1. Database Integration  
The simulator uses historical price data from 2018-03-07 to 2018-03-16 to simulate market conditions. Use SQLite3 to store and query this data.  

#### Code Implementation  
```python  
import sqlite3  

def fetchCoins():  
    connection = sqlite3.connect('./currency_monitor.db')  
    cursor = connection.cursor()  
    query = "SELECT first_leg, ask FROM prices WHERE timestamp='1520408341.52' AND second_leg='USD';"  
    cursor.execute(query)  
    coinAskPrices = cursor.fetchall()  

    coins = {}  
    for coin in coinAskPrices:  
        if coin[0] in coins:  
            continue  
        coins[coin[0]] = {"price": coin[1], "currency": coin[0]}  
        print(f"{coin[0]} â€” ${round(coin[1],4)}")  
    return coins  
```  

### 2. User Interaction Module  
Prompt users to select a cryptocurrency and investment amount:  

```python  
def inputBuy():  
    currency = input("Select the crypto currency you want to buy: ").upper()  
    quantity = float(input("Enter the quantity you want to buy: "))  
    return currency, quantity  
```  

### 3. Simulation Engine  
Calculate investment performance and identify optimal exit points:  

```python  
def runSimulation(boughtPrice, quantity, currency):  
    valueThen = boughtPrice * quantity  
    bestPrice, timestamp = fetchBestBidPriceFromDB(currency)  
    bestValue = bestPrice * quantity  
    priceDifference = (bestValue - valueThen)/valueThen * 100  

    print(f"The best bid price for {currency} was ${bestPrice} at {timestamp}")  
    if priceDifference > 0:  
        print(f"Your total asset value is ${round(bestValue, 4)}, it has increased by {round(priceDifference,2)}%")  
    else:  
        print(f"Your total asset value is ${round(bestValue, 4)}, it has decreased by {round(priceDifference,2)}%")  
```

## Enhancing User Experience  

### Adding Visual Effects  
Implement dramatic text typing for enhanced user engagement:  

```python  
import time  
import sys  

def dramaticTyping(string):  
    for char in string:  
        sys.stdout.write(char)  
        sys.stdout.flush()  
        time.sleep(0.10)  
```  

Replace standard `print()` calls with `dramaticTyping()` in your main script for interactive output.

## FAQ: Common Questions About Crypto Trading Simulators  

**Q: Can I use this simulator for educational purposes?**  
A: Yes, this tool is ideal for learning crypto trading fundamentals and testing strategies without financial risk.  

**Q: What Python version is required?**  
A: The code was developed using Python 2.7, though modifications may be needed for Python 3 compatibility.  

**Q: How accurate is the simulation?**  
A: While based on historical data, the simulator doesn't account for real-time market variables like news events or regulatory changes.  

**Q: Can I add new cryptocurrencies to the database?**  
A: Yes, by expanding the SQLite database schema and updating the `fetchCoins()` function.  

**Q: Is this suitable for advanced traders?**  
A: While designed for beginners, advanced users can enhance the simulator by integrating live market data APIs.
