## What Is USDC?

**USDC** is a **fiat-collateralized stablecoin** issued by **Circle** in partnership with **Coinbase**. It maintains a 1:1 peg with the US dollar, meaning each USDC token is theoretically redeemable for $1.

### Key Features of USDC:
- **Regulatory Compliance**: USDC is backed by reserves held in **US-regulated financial institutions**, including cash and short-term US Treasury bonds.

## Is USDC a Scam? Addressing Legitimacy Concerns

While USDC itself is **not a scam**, users must remain vigilant against fraudulent schemes. Scammers often exploit stablecoins by:
- Promising unrealistic returns (e.g., 20%+ interest on USDC).
- Creating counterfeit tokens or phishing platforms.

Circle and Coinbase ensure transparency through regular audits, but users should **only transact on trusted platforms**. The 2023 USDC depeg incidentâ€”caused by $3.3 billion in reserves held at Silicon Valley Bankâ€”highlights the importance of reserve diversification. However, USDC recovered its peg after Federal Reserve interventions.
