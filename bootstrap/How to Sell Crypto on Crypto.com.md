# How to Sell Crypto on Crypto.com  

Selling cryptocurrency on Crypto.com is a straightforward process, but it requires careful setup of your fiat wallet before initiating transactions. This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough of the steps involved in selling crypto for fiat currency, optimizing your experience with tips for users in different regions. Whether you're converting Bitcoin, Ethereum, or another digital asset, this article covers everything you need to know about the platformâ€™s interface, transaction mechanics, and troubleshooting common issues.  

## Setting Up Your Fiat Wallet  

Before selling crypto on Crypto.com, you must configure your **fiat wallet**. This feature allows you to deposit and manage traditional currencies like USD, EUR, or SGD after converting your digital assets.  

### Step 1: Navigate to "Fiat Wallet"  

1. Open the **Crypto.com app** and log in to your account.  
2. Tap on **"Accounts"** in the bottom navigation bar.  
3. Locate and select **"Fiat Wallet"** from the list of accounts (which includes "Crypto Wallet" and "Crypto Earn").  

> **Pro Tip**: If the "Fiat Wallet" option doesnâ€™t appear, force-close the app and reopen it. The interface may take time to update after account creation.  

### Step 2: Set Up Your Fiat Wallet  

The setup process varies depending on your location:  

- **Singapore Residents**:  
  Connect to **StraitsX** (formerly Xfers), a Southeast Asian payment infrastructure service. Tap **"Connect with StraitsX"** and follow the on-screen instructions to verify your identity and link your bank account.  

- **US and EU Residents**:  
  Select **"Set Up New Currency"**, enter your residential address, and complete verification. Youâ€™ll need to deposit fiat via bank transfer to activate your wallet.  

> **Key Consideration**: Ensure your address details match your government-issued ID to avoid verification delays.

2. Enter the amount of crypto you want to sell. For example, input **0.0001 BTC** for a small test transaction.  
3. Review the estimated fiat value, transaction fees, and total amount before proceeding.  

> **Important**: Transaction fees vary based on the cryptocurrency and your accountâ€™s fee tier. Check Crypto.comâ€™s fee schedule for transparency.  

### Step 6: Confirm and Complete the Sale  

1. Tap **"Sell"** to generate a confirmation screen.  
2. Verify the details (amount, rate, fee, and total cost).  
3. Confirm the transaction by entering your passcode or biometric authentication.  

After completion, the fiat proceeds will appear in your fiat wallet under the **"Today"** transaction list.
