## What Is Bitcoin Cash (BCH)?

### A Forked Legacy  
In 2017, a contentious debate over Bitcoin's scalability led to a **blockchain hard fork**, resulting in two distinct cryptocurrencies:  
- **Bitcoin (BTC)**: Original chain with smaller block sizes  
- **Bitcoin Cash (BCH)**: New chain with larger 8MB blocks (now 32MB)  

This split emerged from disagreements about transaction speed and fees. BCH advocates prioritized fast, low-cost global payments, while BTC supporters focused on security and store-of-value properties.

### Core Features of BCH  
- **Scalable Payments**: Larger blocks enable ~116 transactions/second vs. BTC's 7 TPS  
- **Decentralized Network**: Proof-of-Work consensus maintained by global miners  
- **Fixed Supply**: 21 million token cap ensures scarcity  

ðŸ’¡ *Fun Fact*: Bitcoin Cash's whitepaper explicitly references Satoshi Nakamoto's 2008 vision for digital cash, positioning BCH as a return to Bitcoin's original purpose.

## How Bitcoin Cash Works

### Technical Architecture  
The BCH blockchain employs:  
- **ASIC-Resistant Mining**: SHA-256 algorithm allows diverse mining participation  
- **Difficulty Adjustment**: Retargets every block to maintain 10-minute intervals  
- **Smart Contract Support**: Script language enables basic programmable transactions  

### Fork Evolution  
In 2018, another ideological split created **Bitcoin SV (BSV)**, which advocates for even larger blocks (512MB+). This demonstrates BCH's ongoing role in blockchain experimentation.
