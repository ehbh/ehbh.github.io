## Factors Affecting Mining Profitability

### 1. **GPU Efficiency**
Optimal hardware configurations significantly impact returns. Recommended GPUs include:
- **AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT**: 58 MH/s at 125W
- **NVIDIA RTX 3060**: 45 MH/s at 170W
- **AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT**: 61 MH/s at 125W

### 2. **Power Consumption**
Mining increases electricity usage by 30-50%. Regions with low energy costs (e.g., 0.05 USD/kWh) improve margins.

### 3. **Network Difficulty**
Ethereum's difficulty adjusts every block (~13-15 seconds). Higher network hashpower reduces individual rewards.

### 4. **Cryptocurrency Price Volatility**
Mining profitability fluctuates with ETH price. For example:
- At $2,000 ETH: 0.05 ETH/day = $100 revenue
- At $3,000 ETH: Same hashpower = $150 revenue

## Mining Pool Selection Checklist

1. **Server Proximity**: Choose pools with servers near your location.
2. **Hashrate Stability**: Avoid pools with frequent hashpower drops.
3. **Fee Transparency**: Confirm no hidden charges beyond stated rates.
4. **Payout Thresholds**: Check minimum withdrawal amounts.
5. **Security Features**: Look for SSL encryption and DDoS protection.

## Mining Profitability Calculator Example

**Scenario**: 
- Hardware: 6x RX 6700 XT (366 MH/s total)
- Power: 6x 125W = 750W (0.75 kW)
- Energy Cost: $0.08/kWh
- Pool Fee: 1.0% (SparkPool)
- ETH Price: $3,000

**Daily Earnings**:
- Revenue: 0.18 ETH √ó $3,000 = $540
- Power Cost: 0.75 kW √ó 24h √ó $0.08 = $14.40
- Pool Fee: $540 √ó 1.0% = $5.40
- **Net Profit**: $520.20/day
