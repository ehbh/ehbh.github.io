## FAQ Section

### What Makes Bitcoin ETFs Different From Traditional ETFs?
Bitcoin ETFs track the actual cryptocurrency price rather than company stocks or bonds. They provide regulated exposure without requiring investors to manage digital asset wallets.

### How Do ETFs Impact Bitcoin's Price Volatility?
ETF inflows create sustained buying pressure that can reduce extreme price swings. Historical data shows a 23% decrease in 30-day volatility after major ETF approvals.

US investors should consult tax professionals, but generally ETFs are treated as "collectibles" with 28% maximum capital gains rate for collectibles held over one year.

Yes, through "coin hoarding" effects. Current ETF holdings represent a significant portion of Bitcoin's float, potentially creating supply constraints during bull markets.
