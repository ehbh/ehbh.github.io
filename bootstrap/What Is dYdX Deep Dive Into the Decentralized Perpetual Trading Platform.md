## How Does dYdX Work?  

dYdX operates on two blockchain layers, leveraging Ethereum‚Äôs security and Layer 2‚Äôs scalability:  

### **Ethereum Layer 1 (L1)**  
- **Functionality**: Supports spot trading and margin trading with up to 5x leverage.  
- **Collateral Requirements**: Users must over-collateralize positions (minimum 125%) to mitigate default risks.  
- **Use Case**: Serves as a foundation for basic trading activities, though the platform has shifted focus to Layer 2.  

### **StarkEx Layer 2 (L2)**  
- **Technology**: Utilizes zero-knowledge rollups (zkSTARKs) to process transactions off-chain, reducing gas fees and improving speed.  
- **Key Features**:  
  - Perpetual contracts with up to **25x leverage**.  
  - Cross-margining to prevent liquidation during volatility.  
  - Mobile-friendly interface and near-zero gas fees.  

**Example Workflow**:  
1. Users connect an Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask).  
2. Deposit USDC as collateral.  
3. Trade perpetuals like BTC/USD or ETH/USD with customizable leverage.  

### **Global Lending Pools**  
- **Mechanism**: Smart contracts manage liquidity pools for each supported asset.  
- **Interest Rates**: Determined by supply and demand dynamics.  
- **Security**: Borrowers must provide collateral, ensuring lenders‚Äô funds remain protected.
