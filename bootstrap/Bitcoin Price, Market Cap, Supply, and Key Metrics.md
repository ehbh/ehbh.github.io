# Bitcoin Price, Market Cap, Supply, and Key Metrics  

Bitcoin (BTC) has revolutionized digital finance since its inception in 2009. As the first decentralized cryptocurrency, it introduced a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that eliminates reliance on traditional financial intermediaries. This article explores Bitcoinâ€™s core attributes, market dynamics, and practical insights for investors and enthusiasts.

## What Is Bitcoin (BTC)?  

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency built on blockchain technology. Proposed in 2008 by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakamoto, its whitepaper outlined a vision for a trustless financial system where transactions occur directly between users without intermediaries. Launched in January 2009, Bitcoin leverages cryptographic security and a consensus mechanism called Proof-of-Work (PoW) to validate transactions and secure its network.  

Key features include:  
- **Decentralization**: No central authority governs Bitcoin; it operates on a global network of nodes.  
- **Scarcity**: A capped supply of 21 million BTC ensures deflationary properties.  
- **Transparency**: All transactions are publicly recorded on the blockchain.

## Who Are Bitcoinâ€™s Founders?  

The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto, Bitcoinâ€™s creator, remains a mystery. While early collaborators like Hal Finney and Nick Szabo contributed to cryptographic foundations, Nakamotoâ€™s 2010 exit from the project left Bitcoinâ€™s governance to the community. Today, core developers and miners maintain the protocol, ensuring its decentralized ethos.  

**FAQ: Is Bitcoin associated with any government or company?**  
No. Bitcoin operates independently of governments, corporations, or financial institutions, relying solely on community-driven consensus.

## What Makes Bitcoin Unique?  

Bitcoinâ€™s uniqueness stems from its pioneering role and technical design:  

1. **First-Mover Advantage**: As the original cryptocurrency, Bitcoin established the blueprint for thousands of altcoins.  
2. **Security**: Its PoW mechanism and distributed ledger make it resistant to censorship and fraud.  
3. **Store of Value**: Often dubbed "digital gold," Bitcoinâ€™s scarcity and growing institutional adoption position it as a hedge against inflation.  
4. **Global Accessibility**: Anyone with internet access can send or receive BTC, bypassing traditional banking barriers.

## How Much Bitcoin Is in Circulation?  

As of 2025, over 19.4 million BTC are in circulation, leaving fewer than 1.6 million left to mine. New BTC is created through mining rewards, which halve every 210,000 blocks (~4 years). The next halving, expected in 2028, will reduce the block reward to 3.125 BTC.  

**FAQ: Why is Bitcoinâ€™s supply capped at 21 million?**  
Nakamoto designed Bitcoin with a finite supply to mimic scarce resources like gold, promoting long-term value retention.

## How Is the Bitcoin Network Secured?  

Bitcoinâ€™s security relies on:  
- **Decentralized Nodes**: Thousands of nodes validate transactions, ensuring no single point of failure.  
- **Mining Power**: Miners compete to solve cryptographic puzzles, securing the network with computational effort.  
- **Immutable Ledger**: Once recorded, transactions cannot be altered without consensus.  

**Threats and Mitigations**:  
- **51% Attacks**: Theoretically possible but prohibitively expensive for attackers.  
- **Quantum Computing**: Future risks are mitigated by ongoing cryptographic upgrades.
