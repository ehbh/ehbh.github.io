## Local vs. International Exchanges in Japan  

Japan‚Äôs cryptocurrency ecosystem features two distinct exchange categories: **domestic platforms** and **international platforms**. Each has trade-offs in terms of regulation, fees, and crypto availability.  

### Domestic Exchanges: Compliance vs. Limitations  
1. **Limited Coin Selection**  
   Japanese exchanges like Bitflyer and DMM Bitcoin offer fewer than 30 cryptocurrencies, as listings require Financial Services Agency (FSA) approval.  
2. **Higher Fees**  
   Regulatory compliance and local protections result in elevated trading fees compared to international rivals.  
3. **Taxation**  
   Profits from domestic exchanges are subject to Japan‚Äôs 20.42% consumption tax on crypto gains.  
4. **Convenient Fiat Onboarding**  
   Local platforms allow seamless yen (JPY) deposits via bank transfers, credit cards, or mobile payment apps like PayPay.  

### International Exchanges: Diversity and Accessibility  
1. **Wider Crypto Selection**  
   Platforms like Binance and OKX list 100+ cryptocurrencies, including niche tokens unavailable domestically.  
2. **Competitive Fees**  
   Global exchanges often offer lower fees (0.1% or less) and loyalty programs for high-volume traders.  
3. **Regulatory Risks**  
   Non-compliant platforms may restrict Japanese users or require workarounds for access.
